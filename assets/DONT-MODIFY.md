# Assets Directory
This directory holds files processed by gulp and waiting to be processed by Jekyll.
Do not modify these files as they may be overridden by gulp tasks.

Think of this as a temporary file that should not be touched.
*this directory will be called temp (or the like) once I figure out how to change file names on jekyll build...*

## Generate Content
- run **gulp build** to generate files into this directory
- run **jekyll build** to process the files within this directory into the jekyll \_site directory.
