      <h2 class="headline">Hi, I'm Miranda... </h2>
      <p>...and I love to create. By day I'm a web developer, and at night I crochet--often by computer light.
      My mom taught me to crochet when I was young, and after a long hiatus (or two) it has become an obsession. Now I have more yarn filling boxes and falling off shelves than I know what to do with.</p>
      <p>I'm a self-professed nerd and pluviophile, born and raised in the Pacific North West.</p>
