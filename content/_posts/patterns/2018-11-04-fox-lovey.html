about: "Sunny and Acorn are created using a 12-point star blanket. The blanket uses turns, so you won't have to cut the yarn each time to change colors. Sunny (fuzzy) and Acorn (standard) are made from two different pattern. Their designs are very similar but vary to accommodate different yarn types. Acorn is designed for worsted/aran yarn throughout, where Sunny's design also includes fuzzy yarn (suggested Bernat Pipsqueak).
Each pattern includes step-by-step instructions, photos, and assembly directions."
