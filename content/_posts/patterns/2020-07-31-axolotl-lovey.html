about: "Azolla is a 12-point star blanket lovey, with a head, two arms, and a tail.
This pattern includes step-by-step instructions, photos, and assembly directions.
<br><br>
The gills are built into the head using cord stitches (see link for special techniques below).
This keeps the gills secureed to the head and simplifies assembly.
<br><br>
The head is created with a separate layer for the snout to keep the stuffing from immediatly squishing into main part of the head."
