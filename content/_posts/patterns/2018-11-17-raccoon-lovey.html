about: "Pebble and Twig are created using a 12-point star blanket. The blanket uses turns, so you won't have to cut the yarn each time to change colors. Pebble (fuzzy) and Twig (standard) are made from two different pattern. Their designs are very similar but vary to accommodate different yarn types. Twig is designed for worsted/aran yarn throughout, where Pebble's design also includes fuzzy yarn (suggested Bernat Pipsqueak).
Each pattern includes step-by-step instructions, photos, and assembly directions."
