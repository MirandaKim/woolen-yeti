# SRC Directory
This is the working source directory. Make changes within this directory, then run task 'gulp build' to she the processed results moved into ~/assets directory.

Those processed files in turn (~/assets) can be processed into Jekyll content by running task 'jekyll build'. The jekyll files should appear in the ~/\_site directory.
